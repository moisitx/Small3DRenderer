# 3D Shape Renderer

This project is a Java application that allows visualization and interaction with different 3D shapes in a graphical environment. It uses the Swing library for the user interface and applies matrix transformations to rotate the figures in a three-dimensional space.

## Features

- **Rendering of 3D shapes** in a graphical window.  
- **Interactive rotation** of shapes using horizontal and vertical sliders.  
- **Selection of different geometric shapes** for visualization.  
- **Sorting objects by depth** for correct rendering.
