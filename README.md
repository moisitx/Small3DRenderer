![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947d3df8-d2c3-4b54-a176-e9f45d46e682)

This project is a Java application that allows visualization and interaction with different 3D shapes made up of rectangles and triangles in a graphical environment. It uses the Swing library for the user interface and applies matrix transformations to rotate the figures in a three-dimensional space.

## Features

- **Rendering of 3D shapes** in a graphical window.  
- **Interactive rotation** of shapes using horizontal and vertical sliders.  
- **Selection of different geometric shapes** for visualization.  
- **Sorting objects by depth** for correct rendering.
